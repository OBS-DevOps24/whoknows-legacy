# Reflection about the use of branching strategies in the project

We used GitHub flow strategy as mentioned [here](../mandatory-1/branching-strategy.md). This strategy was chosen because we have used it on previous projects and it has worked well for us.

The branching strategy was very useful in our project. It helped us to work on different features without interfering with each other's work. We created a new branch for each feature or task and worked on it independently. After the feature/task was completed, we created a pull request and merged in to the main branch.

Overall we had zero merge conflicts and the branching strategy worked very well for us. After the task was completed and merged into the main branch, we deleted the branch to keep remove redundant branches.
