# Branching Strategy

## GitHub Flow

We have chosen GitHub Flow as our branching strategy because:

1. **Simplicity**: GitHub Flow is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses a single `main` branch with short-lived feature branches, making it simple to manage and follow.

2. **Continuous Integration**: By merging small, frequent changes into the `main` branch, GitHub Flow encourages continuous integration. This helps catch issues early and ensures that the `main` branch is always in a deployable state.

3. **Collaboration**: GitHub Flow promotes collaboration through pull requests. Team members can review and discuss changes before they are merged, improving code quality and knowledge sharing.

4. **Deployment**: With GitHub Flow, deployments are straightforward. Since the `main` branch is always in a deployable state, you can deploy to production at any time with confidence.

5. **Transparency**: The use of pull requests and branch naming conventions provides transparency. It is easy to track the progress of features and see what is being worked on.
