# How are you DevOps?

## Ways we are DevOps:

- CI/CD pipeline
- Good feedback via monitoring stack, issue management, issue template, pr template
- Documentation
- Testing in backend, end2end test, postman monitoring/integration test
- Kanban board

## Ways we are not DevOps:

- No staging server for that memics the prod environment.
  - Due to funding limitations, we only have a prod environment.
- Logging in the backend is not implemented.
- Monitoring is not implemented fully
  - Not all metrics are present (we plan to fix this in the future).
- There is no automatic configuration for the dev environment, this is done manually.

## TODO:

- In ways we are devops, add something about:
  - Flow
  - Feedback
  - Continual learning and experimentation

- In ways we are not DevOps, add something about:
