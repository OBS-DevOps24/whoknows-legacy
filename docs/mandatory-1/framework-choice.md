# Choosing a Framework

## Overview

This document summarizes the considerations from our discussions on selecting a framework for rewriting the legacy codebase. The objective is to choose a framework that guarantees maintainability, scalability, security, and ease of development, while aligning with the project’s requirements.

## Conclusion

After evaluating the various options, we have chosen C# with ASP.NET Core for the backend and React for the frontend. This decision was guided by several key factors:

- Maintainability: The separation of concerns between the backend and frontend allows for more modular and maintainable code. React's component-based architecture further enhances maintainability.
- Scalability: ASP.NET Core's modern, high-performance architecture ensures that the application can scale effectively as demand grows.
- Security: With ASP.NET Core’s built-in security features, such as authentication and protection against common web vulnerabilities, the framework provides robust security out of the box.
- Ease of development: React's declarative approach and rich ecosystem simplify the development of dynamic and interactive user interfaces. The API-first architecture allows for clear separation between frontend and backend, enabling flexibility for future changes.

This framework meets the project’s objectives for maintainability, scalability, security, and ease of development, making it the optimal choice for the rewrite.

## Option 1: C# + .NET (Backend) + Razor Pages (Frontend)

### Description

- **Backend**: C# with **ASP.NET Core**.
- **Frontend**: **Server-side rendering** using **Razor Pages**

### Pros

- **Full-stack C#**: Both backend and frontend are handled within the same framework, reducing complexity and ensuring consistent tooling.
- **Tight integration**: Razor Pages are fully integrated with ASP.NET Core, allowing for seamless development with minimal configuration.
- **Server-side rendering**: Provides better SEO, faster initial page load, and good performance for content-driven sites.
- **Simplified deployment**: Since both the backend and frontend are within the same project, there is less deployment overhead.
- **Strong security**: ASP.NET Core offers built-in authentication, authorization, and protection against CSRF, XSS, and other vulnerabilities.

### Cons

- **Limited interactivity**: Razor Pages are primarily for server-rendered applications, and building highly interactive UIs can be more cumbersome compared to using a client-side framework like React.
- **Less dynamic UX**: For applications requiring dynamic, real-time updates or rich user interfaces, Razor may feel restrictive.
- **Scaling client-side complexity**: As the frontend becomes more complex, Razor Pages may be harder to manage compared to client-side frameworks like React.

## Option 2: C# + .NET (Backend) + React (Frontend)

### Description

- **Backend**: C# with **ASP.NET Core**.
- **Frontend**: **React**.

### Pros

- **Rich user interfaces**: React is highly suited for building dynamic, interactive, and complex UIs, making it a good fit for feature-rich, modern web applications.
- **Component-based architecture**: Promotes reusability, modularity, and better organization of the frontend code.
- **Asynchronous updates**: React efficiently manages real-time data changes and updates the UI without requiring full-page reloads, improving user experience.
- **API-first architecture**: Allows for clear separation between frontend and backend, enabling flexibility for future changes (e.g., changing the backend or integrating with other services).

### Cons

- **Two languages**: Requires proficiency in both C# for the backend and JavaScript/TypeScript for the frontend, which increases the learning curve for the development team.

## Decision Criteria

1. **Project Requirements**:

   - Does the application need highly interactive, dynamic UIs (favoring React/Blazor)?
   - Or is it content-heavy with a focus on server-side rendering and SEO (favoring Razor Pages)?

2. **Scalability and Maintainability**:
   - How complex is the anticipated frontend logic?
   - Does the separation of concerns between frontend and backend matter (favoring React)?
   - Is it important to minimize the number of technologies used (favoring Razor Pages or Blazor)?
